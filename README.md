# Introduction to deep learning

This project was created as a hands-on introduction to **PyTorch** and **hyperparameter tuning** for deep learning models. Three different neural network architectures were built and experimented with to understand their performance and behaviors across various hyperparameter settings.

## Architectures

The project includes implementations of the following architectures:

1. **Shallow Net**: A simple network with minimal layers to observe fundamental learning dynamics.
2. **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**: A classic fully-connected neural network with multiple hidden layers.
3. **LeNet-5**: A convolutional network inspired by the LeNet-5 architecture, widely known for its role in early image classification tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- Tensorboard
Install dependencies with:
```bash
  pip install tensorboard
```
